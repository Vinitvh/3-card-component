## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I have used SASS which I am using for the first time.

```css
@mixin button($theme) {
  ...
  &:hover {
    ...
  }
```

### Continued development

Though I like using SASS, still not to structure it properly. Will learn more and like to use in my future projects.
